Take account of everything you've done online so far [today]. If you're like most tech-savvy people, you've probably checked your email, scrolled through your social media feed, and browsed a few of your favorite websites - perhaps even before breakfast. But have you ever given a thought to the work that went into the virtual platforms that you visit every day? 

Believe it or not, each of the websites, apps, and games that you flip through in seconds is the result of hours of programming work. 

Programming is a fantastic career path with great potential for growth, especially since so much of our lives are now lived online. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the profession will grow by a full 13 percent between 2018 and 2028 - over twice the average rate of growth expected for all other occupations. 

According to Payscale, the majority of programmers feel happy about their success, confident in their skills, and secure about their financial futures; the profession enjoys a 4.5 ranking (out of 5) for satisfaction.
